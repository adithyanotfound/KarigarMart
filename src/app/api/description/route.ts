Product 1: Zara jute tote bag

<VIDEO_NARRATION_STARTS>
A stylish Instagram advertisement video for Zara, showcasing a jute tote bag. The setting is an urban street café at golden hour, with warm sunlight and a modern, minimalistic aesthetic. The mood is chic, eco-friendly, and aspirational. Cinematic camera style with smooth motion, no text, no narration. Shot 1 (0–2s): A young fashionable woman in her mid-20s, wearing neutral-toned chic clothing (white sleeveless top, beige linen trousers), walks confidently down a sunlit street with the jute tote bag on her shoulder. The background is softly blurred city life with pastel buildings. Shot 2 (2–5s): Close-up slow-motion of the jute tote bag swaying naturally as she walks. Focus on the rich, textured jute fibers catching golden sunlight, giving the bag a luxurious eco-friendly vibe. Shot 3 (5–7s): The woman sets the bag down on a wooden café table beside an iced coffee. Camera smoothly tracks the bag, making it the centerpiece of the frame. Shot 4 (7–8s, Final Hero Shot): Cinematic close-up of the tote bag on the table, glowing in warm sunlight, with the blurred silhouette of the woman sipping coffee in the background. Audio: Upbeat, minimal lo-fi house track with a trendy Instagram reel vibe. Subtle ambient café sounds (soft chatter, clinking cups, breeze) under the music. No voices, no text.

Product 2: Zara jute tote bag

<VIDEO_NARRATION_STARTS>
A bright, trendy outdoor café scene during golden hour with soft sunlight reflecting off glass windows. The camera pans smoothly across a wooden table where a stylish young woman (mid-20s, South Asian, with long wavy hair, chic casual outfit – white linen shirt and light blue jeans) places a minimal, eco-friendly jute tote bag on the table. The tote bag looks premium, textured with natural fibers, and stands out against the warm background. She adjusts her sunglasses and smiles confidently as she grabs the tote by its handles. The video cuts to a slow-motion shot of her walking past green plants with the tote swinging naturally at her side. In the background, blurred city life adds movement without distracting from the bag. Background music: upbeat, modern lo-fi pop with light percussion and warm synths, catchy enough to feel trendy but not overwhelming. Voiceover pitch (female, confident yet friendly tone): 'Eco is the new chic. Carry style that cares. Discover evrgrn's jute tote – your everyday essential, reimagined.' Ambient sound design: subtle café chatter and clinking cups at the beginning, fading into upbeat background music as the focus shifts to the walking scene. Ending (last 2 seconds): camera zooms slightly closer to the tote bag as sunlight highlights its natural fibers. Music hits a crisp beat drop right at the end for emphasis.
